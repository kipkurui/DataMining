# Status of Open Science: Data Mining

The purpose of this project is to mine relevant literature to determine how often researchers in East Africa or Africa as a whole make code and data access when they publish. 


## Set up
Some tools to install
1. Followed these instructions: https://github.com/softwaresaved/code-cite/blob/master/notebooks/getpapers.ipynb
2. Used this to setup nvm: https://github.com/blahah/installing-node-tools
3. Use this<https://github.com/ContentMine/getpapers/wiki/europepmc-query-format> resource to explore more query options. For now, we are not getting the expected results
4. And this: http://europepmc.org/docs/EBI_Europe_PMC_Web_Service_Reference.pdf


Useful resources.
1.  A paper of analysis paper reviews: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-017-2240-2
2. https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2016/04/12/contentmine-is-alpha-ready-for-you-to-use-hacking-on-thursdayfriday/
3. https://github.com/softwaresaved/code-cite: See what they did in this hackathon. How do we get the papers published in a given country? Borrow a lot from this. The difference for us to find out, compared with other nations, how often do we make data and code accessible?
